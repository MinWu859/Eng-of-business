            <img src="project4.jpg" width="500" height="500">
            <p>Hi my name is Min Wu and I am currently a senior at Penn State majoring in Digital
                Media. I have learned a lot of specialized knowledge in this major, such as
                text-Analysis, statistics, animation, and website creation. I think that learning
                these professional skills can potentially help me in my future career.</p>
            <p>I have previously interned at two professional media companies. During my internship,
                I helped the companies plan the content of short videos and promos, created short
                video scripts, post-edited the promos, and researched how to increase the number of
                views and views of short videos. These internship projects gave me a deeper
                understanding of the media industry and helped me acquire many professional
                skills.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I like to play music and read books related to business studies.
                Piano and ukulele are my best instruments. I also enjoy reading the autobiographies
                of successful entrepreneurs and learning about their past events.</p>
            <p>My goal is to create a big strategy game with my partners and start our own famous game company.</p>
